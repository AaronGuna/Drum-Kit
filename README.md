# Drum-Kit
I created this interactive Drum Kit project as a hands-on exercise to practice JavaScript. The webpage features a set of virtual drums, each corresponding to a key. When you press the keys, the corresponding drum sounds are played. It's a fun and engaging way to learn and experiment with JavaScript event handling and audio. Enjoy making some beats!
